## Practical 5
### Files
- `fibonacci.c` - Computes and prints out the fibonacci sequence up to Fn, where n is a user given value. 
- `arctanh.c` - Computes the `arctanh(x)` for x ranging from `-0.9` to `0.9`. arctanh is computed by two different methods and their results is compared.
### Compiling and running 
```bash
# Compile
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
gcc -o arctanh arctanh.c -lm
# To run
./fibonacci
./arctanh
```
