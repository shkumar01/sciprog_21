## Practical 6
### Files
- `matmult.c` - Contains function to multiply two given matrices
- `main.c` - Driver code to set up to matrices to multiply and then calls matmult function to multiply them. Additionally it prints out all the matrices.
- `Makefile` - Makefile to compile and link all of the source files in this directory
### Compiling and running 
```bash
# Compile and link
make all
# Run 
./mm 
# Clean (removes object (*.o) files and the executable)  
make clean 
```
